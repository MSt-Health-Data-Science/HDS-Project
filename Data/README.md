# [Patient-level dataset to study the effect of COVID-19 in people with Multiple Sclerosis](https://physionet.org/content/patient-level-data-covid-ms/1.0.0/)


## Abstract
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, causing increased vulnerability to infections and disability among young adults. Ever since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections, there have been concerns among people with MS (PwMS) about the potential interactions between various disease-modifying therapies and COVID-19. The COVID-19 in MS Global Data Sharing Initiative (GDSI) was initiated in 2020 to address these concerns. This paper focuses on the anonymisation and open-sourcing of a GDSI sub-dataset, comprising data entered by people with MS and clinicians using a fast data entry tool. The dataset includes demographics, comorbidities, hospital stay, and COVID-19 symptoms of PwMS. The dataset can be used to perform different statistical analyses to improve our understanding of COVID-19 in MS. Furthermore, this dataset can also be used within the context of educational activities to educate different stakeholders on the complex data science topics that were used within the GDSI.

## Methods
This dataset was collected via a fast data entry tool that allowed clinicians, people with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS), or their representatives to enter data directly into the central platform of the COVID-19 and MS Global Data Sharing Initiative. The tool provided a questionnaire based on predetermined variables and did not collect directly identifiable personal data to protect privacy. The tool has since been taken down as of February 3rd, 2022.

The dataset consists of a total of 1141 people with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS), and to ensure the data's compliance with HIPAA guidelines, a thorough de-identification process was performed. After the data acquisition, a small cell risk assessment (SCRA) was carried out to categorize the variables into three categories: direct identifiers, sensitive variables, and indirect identifiers. Direct identifiers are unique variables that can identify a person without additional information, while sensitive variables are those that a respondent may not want to disclose. Indirect identifiers are non-unique variables that can re-identify an individual when combined with other indirect identifiers from another dataset.

Since no patient names were collected, the focus was on de-identifying dates and patient age. The dates in the 'stop_or_end_date_combined' column were shifted by a random number of days between -15 and 15 for each row to prevent re-identification through date information. Ages were categorized into four groups: 0 for ages between 0 and <18, 1 for ages between 18 and ≤50, 2 for ages between 51 and ≤70, and 3 for ages 71 or greater. By doing this, it was ensured that no specific ages above 90 were disclosed. After categorizing the variables and applying the necessary precautions, the dataset is de-identified and compliant with HIPAA guidelines while maintaining its utility for research purposes. Moreover, to ensure privacy preservation, techniques such as K-anonymity and diversity have been applied to the dataset.

The dataset includes a range of predetermined variables (n=47), such as sex, age category, MS type, EDSS score, smoking status, and BMI category. These variables provide insight into the patient's demographics, clinical characteristics, and COVID-19-related symptoms. A detailed description of the types of variables and their statistics has been provided in the Data Description section.

## Data Description
The file "GDSI_OpenDataset_Final.csv" consists of data collected from 1141 people with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) as part of the COVID-19 and MS Global Data Sharing Initiative. The dataset includes various categorical and numerical variables, such as sex, MS type, smoking status, age category, EDSS score, COVID-19 symptoms and BMI category. The data were collected to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on PwMS and support research and analysis related to the disease. The dataset has been further anonymized using K-anonymity and ℓ-diversity to protect the privacy of the patients and is available for use by the research community.

Usage Notes
The dataset acquisition pipeline was developed using Python programming language, and the data is provided in a CSV format, which makes it compatible with a variety of data analysis tools and software packages. The pipeline utilized popular Python libraries, including matplotlib 3.6.0, pandas 1.5.3, NumPy 1.24, and SciPy 1.0 for data aggregation, statistical analysis (e.g., bias checks using chi-squared test), and visualization. Jupyter Notebook 5.0 served as the interface for the pipeline.

To assist the user community in both the collection and analysis of the data, the code and tools developed for this dataset are available through GitHub [5].
